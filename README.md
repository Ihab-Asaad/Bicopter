# Bicopter
Bicopter is unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with only two thrust motors and two steering motors that control the rotation of the thrust motors, changing the thrust motors' force direction and compensating for the lower number of thrust motors compared to multi-rotor UAVs (like quadcopter). This tilting mechanism allows the bicopter to balance and move in space, as well as rotate the thrust motors so that they are oriented horizontally, as with the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.
