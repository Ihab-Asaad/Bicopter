# Bicopter
Bicopter is a UAV, characterized by the presence of only two thrust motors and two steering motors which control the rotation of thrust motors, thus changing the force direction of thrust motors and
compensating the reduction in the number of thrust motors compared to multi-rotor UAVs (like quadcopter). This tilting mechanism allows the bi-copter to balance and move in space, as well as the ability to rotate the thrust motors so that they are located horizontally, as in Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.
